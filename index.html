<h1>I love you enough to fight for you,
<br>compromise for you, and sacrifce
<br>myself for you if need be. Enough to
<br>miss you incredibly when we're apart,
<br>no matter what length of time it is 
<br>for and regardless of the long
<br>distance. Enough to believe in our
<br>relationship, to stand by it through
<br>the worst of times, to have faith in
<br>our strength as a couple, and to never
<br>give up on us. Enough to spend the rest
<br>of my life with you, be there for you 
<br>when you need, or want me, and never
<br>ever want to leave you, or to live
<br>without you. 
<br>

<br>I love you so much
